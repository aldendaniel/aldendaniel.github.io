  <h3>The Summer Day</h3><br>
     <div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left;">
      Who made the world?<br>
      Who made the swan, and the black bear?<br>
      Who made the grasshopper?<br>
      This grasshopper, I mean--<br>
      the one who has flung herself out of the grass,<br>
      the one who is eating sugar out of my hand,<br>
      who is moving her jaws back and forth instead of up and down --<br>
      who is gazing around with her enormous and complicated eyes.<br>
      Now she lifts her pale forearms and thoroughly washes her face.<br>
      Now she snaps her wings open, and floats away.<br>
      I don't know exactly what a prayer is.<br>
      I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down<br>
      into the grass, how to kneel in the grass,<br>
      how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields<br>
      which is what I have been doing all day.<br>
      Tell me, what else should I have done?<br>
      Doesn't everything die at last, and too soon?<br>
      Tell me, what is it you plan to do<br>
      With your one wild and precious life?<br>
      <br>
